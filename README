The purpose of this program is to provide the user with a way to play the
world game with randomly generated 5-character words. The game works the
same as any other wordle game such that if a letter is highlighted yello, it
appears in the word but is currently in the wrong position. If a letter is
green it is in the word and in the right position. Otherwise, the letter does
not appear in the correct word.

This project taught me to create an interactive website using html and 
javascript as well as API's. Besides this, it taught me to use css to enhance
the user experience when playing the game.


/*****************************************************************************
